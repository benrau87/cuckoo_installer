**Notes**

A Moloch admin will be created, but a standard user named 'cuckoo' with password 'toor' will be available there are some fields that need to be provided during the Moloch installation so hang around.

IRMA will be installed if you have VT-x 

If using vmcloak to install VMs and you do not have VT-x, you can only use 1 core!
