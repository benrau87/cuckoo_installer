# cuckoo_test

**Tested on v2.0.3**

Have an oinkcode ready if you want to use Snort

A Moloch admin will be created, but a standard user named 'cuckoo' with password 'toor' will be available

Run the setup.sh

Switch to your cuckoo user

Run the firstrun.sh script

Create some VMs and add them to the conf virtualbox file(not in the scope of this script)

Start cuckoo with the start_cuckoo.sh script on your cuckoo user in their home directory

Supporting scripts are in your git directory and contain scripts to run
signature updates, create VMs and install TOR as a routing option.
